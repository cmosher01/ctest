ctest

ctest is a very tiny unit testing framework for ANSI C.

The entire framework consist of just two source files: ctest.h and ctest.c

To use the ctest framework, just add these two source files directly
to the C-code to be tested. Instructions for use are in ctest.h file.

Project goals:
1. small
2. simple
3. universal
4. no dependencies
5. absolutely bug-free
